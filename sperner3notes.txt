given 3 members dealing with 3 chores, we give a total budget of $1500 for the 3.  With this, we receive output:

Buffalo-Hirds-MacBook-Pro:186-Final-Project thegator12321$ python sperner3.py < sperner_test1.txt 
[None, None, 1]
[None, 1, None]
[2, None, None]


[None, 3, None]
[2, None, None]
[None, None, None]


[3, None, None]
[None, None, None]
[None, None, None]

Drawing this graph, we can clearly see that the end result is that each user pays $500 with the allocations as we triangulate our sinks which surround innermost triangle.
